CNC Config Archive

This archive folder contains the original config for the cnc mill when it was first converted to use LinuxCNC.  It contains historical wiring diagrams, configs, and other misc. documentation.

It is important to note, that this version of the cnc mill controller did not use a MESA FPGA, but instead used 2 parallel ports.  One was located on the motherboard, the other was on a PCI card.  These controlled a PMDX-132 and PMDX-122 respectively.
