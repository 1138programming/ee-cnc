# Eagle Engineering CNC Mill Config

The current machine config for the primary cnc mill can be used by downloading the **configs** and **hm2** directories.

- **configs** is the folder that contains the files necessary for LinuxCNC
- **hm2** contains firmware info used by the *pncconf* tool to be able to generate the config above
- - Flashing the firmware in hm2 to the 6i25 using *mesaflash* is required for proper operation

## Archive
- **archive** contains info for older generations of the mill.
